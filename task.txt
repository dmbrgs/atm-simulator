ATM simulator. 

Tesk Description:

Our client is a large US bank that would like to open a branch in Riga.
To start operating they need to set up 20 ATMs around the city.
The physical ATMs are already in place, however they require a proper OS.
The client has chosen RobEd Solutions to develop a tailor made software solution for them. 

The end product must accept and process credit cards, and ensure smooth user experience. 
Complete error prone real-life flow that covers all possible scenarios must be in place.
RobEd is known for its exceptional expertise within the Latvian banking sector, and we must defend our reputation.
The client trusted us to figure out the business part of the problem as well.
